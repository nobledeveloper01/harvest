        Nothing matched — but there are two very different reasons for that,
        and collapsing them is how a gate ends up unable to pass.

        Either the path is wrong (a typo, or a directory that was renamed), in
        which case this must fail loudly. Or the directory exists and holds no
        code with executable lines yet — at phase 0 the Harvest domain is enums
        and nothing else, and Dart's coverage output omits a file with nothing
        to run.

        The second is a real state, not a mistake, and reporting it as a
        failure would make the honest response "delete the gate".
